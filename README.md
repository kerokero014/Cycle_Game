# Cycle

Make the other player crash into you.

## What this programm does.

Cycle is a game based on the movie Tron Bicycles drive and make paths trying to make the other person crash into their trial and loss. 
This code started as the Snake code then was recycled and reused to create this program. 
We deleted it the Snake, Food, and Score classes because in this game we did not need to have them or use them. 

With the snake game there was only one snake so we had to changet it to have two "snakes" or bicycles. 
We modified the following files in order to create this program. 

Classes modified: 

DrawActors.cs
Script.cs
Program.cs
Constants.cs 
MoveActors.cs
HandleCollisions.cs
ControlActors.cs
keyboardServices.cs
Player.cs

The player.cs class was created in order to have the two players. 
```
A way we used Polymorphism we used the override mode in order to change the trial of the two bikes, we also used it in order to know the  keys they will press and how for example every time the head of the bike will leave a trail and where the one behind the head is supposed to follow the one infront.
